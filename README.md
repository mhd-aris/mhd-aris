Iâ€™m an **Associate Software Engineer** and a recent graduate in **Informatics Engineering**.

I enjoy creating things that solve real problems and make life a little easier from improving workflows in enterprise projects to exploring new ideas in **Web3**. Iâ€™m curious by nature and love working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow.

Iâ€™m also active in the **DevWeb3Jogja** community and often take part in hackathons. Right now, Iâ€™m building projects that excite me whether they live in **Web3**, **SaaS**, or somewhere in between.

Feel free to explore my work and connect!
