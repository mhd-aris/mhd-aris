# Hi, Iâ€™m Aris ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Associate Software Engineer and a recent graduate in Informatics Engineering.  

I enjoy creating things that solve real problems and make life a little easier from improving workflows in enterprise projects to exploring new ideas in Web3. Iâ€™m curious by nature and love working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow.  

Iâ€™m also active in the **DevWeb3Jogja** community and often take part in hackathons. Right now, Iâ€™m building projects that excite me whether they live in Web3, SaaS, or somewhere in between.  

Feel free to explore my work and connect!
